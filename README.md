##Contents:

* **branches**: The CPU and GPU code for 4 packet processing applications: IPv4 forwarding, IPv6 forwarding, L2 switching, and NDN forwarding is available in different branches of this repository.

* **antlr**: ANTLR code for the G-Opt transformation.

 * **antlr/actual**: Sample applications for benchmarking the transformation.
 * **antlr/actual/aho-corasick**: Optimized code for pattern matching in intrusion detection.

* **l2fwd**: DPDK code for full-system benchmarks (contents vary for different branches).

* **data_dump**: Contains data files for:
 1. Unique IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes from RouteViews.
 2. Processed IPv6 prefixes: suitable for trie insertion.
 3. Snort 2.9.7's valid rules, inserted patterns, and probed packets.

##Dependencies and limitations:
* This code has been tested with `DPDK 1.5.0r0` and `CUDA 6.0`.
* Some of the packet forwarding (at the server) and packet generation (at the clients) is specialized to our hardware. It should be straightforward to modify it for your hardware.
